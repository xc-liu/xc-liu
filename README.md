Hi! I'm Xuecong, and some of you know me as Sabrina. I'm currently a data analyst at the [Babyshop Group](https://career.babyshopgroup.com/). Ex-physicist, Machine Learning master graduate from KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Sweden, and co-founder at [Riedia](http://www.riedia.com/) (an AI-powered news startup, now closed).
