Hi! I'm Xuecong, and some of you know me as Sabrina. I am a master's student in Machine Learning at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Sweden, currently on an exchange study at Politecnico di Milano! I have a backgroud in physics and have research experience in astrophysics, using neural networks to find the equation of states of compact stars. 🌌

👩‍💻 I'm working on outside-vehicle air quality prediction at [CabinAir](https://cabinair.com/en/), [BlueAir](https://www.blueair.com/). In my spare time, I work on NLP projects (text summarisation, etc.) at [Riedia](http://www.riedia.com/), a news startup, as a co-founder and Machine Learning engineer. We stive to provide summarised, fact-checked, and personalised news for readers.

🌱 I'm learning a lot in my Machine Learning program, in topics including data mining methods, reinforcement learning, computer vision, and language engineering. I'm especially excited to see how reinforcement learning can be used in natural language processing!
